# H&R 2020 - VR Robot Explorer
 **[Our Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/hnr2020-vr-robot)**

This is basically a robot which is controlled by VR. The robot has two cameras and some sensors which are used to give users data about the environment the robot is in. Input from the camera and sensors is displayed on the VR headset. The clients can rotate their headset, which will cause the robot's camera to rotate in the same direction, and by touching the side button of the headset, the robot will start or stop moving.

The project consists of 4 main modules: The client, server, Raspberry Pi and Arduino. All 4 modules communicate with each other either directly or through another module to ensure that the robot functions as expected.

## Module list
 - [Client Module](https://github.com/team-unununium/HnR-2020-VR-Client)
 - [Server Module](https://github.com/team-unununium/HnR-2020-VR-Server)
 - [Raspberry Pi Module](https://github.com/team-unununium/HnR-2020-VR-Pi)
 - [Arduino Module](https://github.com/team-unununium/HnR-2020-VR-Arduino)

# Current module - Raspberry Pi
The Raspberry Pi module is in charge of facilitating communication between the Arduino and the server. It uses [picamera](https://picamera.readthedocs.io/), [python-socketio](https://python-socketio.readthedocs.io/) and [pyFirmata2](https://github.com/berndporr/pyFirmata2). It also provides the live video feed to the clients. The identity of the raspberry pi is confirmed by the server through a common secret, which is the `SERVER_ROBOT_SECRET`.

## How to install
After cloning the repository, just run  `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` then `python main.py`  and you should be good to go!
 
## Installation notes
- As the module requires a live video feed, a camera module would need to be attached to the Raspberry Pi for the module to function.
- The `SERVER_ROBOT_SECRET` between the robot and the server is hardcoded for now, but it will be added as an argument in the future. Currently, to change the secret, you may need to change the `SERVER_ROBOT_SECRET` located in each file manually.
- The default server that the robot connects to is [unununium.pcchin.com](https://unununium.pcchin.com/). To modify the server, you may need to modify the URL located in each file. This will be added as an argument in the future.
